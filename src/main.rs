// Mandelbrot set
// The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which z does not fly out to infinity.

// Infinite loop, Squaring any number smaller than 1 makes it smaller, so it approaches zero; squaring 1 yields 1; squaring a number larger than 1 makes it larger, so it approaches infinity; and squaring a negative number makes it positive, after which it behaves as one of the prior cases
// fn square_loop(mut x: f64) {
//     loop {
//         x = x * x;
//     }
// }

// Modified
// If c is greater than 0.25, or less than â€“2.0, then x eventually becomes infinitely large; otherwise, it stays somewhere in the neighborhood of zero.
// fn square_add_loop(c: f64) {
//     let mut x = 0;
//     loop {
//         x = x * x + c;
//     }
// }

        // re: T,

        // Imaginary portion of the complex number
        // im: T

/// Try to determine if `c` is in the Mandelbrot set, using at most `limit`
/// iterations to decide.
///
/// If `c` is not a member, return `Some(i)`, where `i` is the number of
/// iterations it took for `c` to leave the circle of radius two centered on the
/// origin. If `c` seems to be a member (more precisely, if we reached the
/// iteration limit without being able to prove that `c` is not a member),

// This function takes the complex number c that we want to test for membership in the Mandelbrot set, and a limit on the number of iterations to try before giving up and declaring c to probably be a member.
// The function;s return value is an Option<u32>. An Option is an enumerated type, often called an enum because its definition enumerates several variants that a value of this type could be:
// For any type T, a value of type Option<T> is either Some(v), where v is a value of type T, or None, indicating no T value is available.
// Option is a generic type, we can use it to represent an optional value of any type T we'd like.
// enum Option<T> {
//     None,
//     Some(T)
// }
